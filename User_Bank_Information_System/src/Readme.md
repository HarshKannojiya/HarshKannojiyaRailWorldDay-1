I have made a project on user banking information system in which i have performed many tasks in following ways -
1. I have used JDBC for this project.
2. The purpose of this project is to create a user for bank and create a account instantly at a time of login.
3. But all crud operations depends on admin who have all control all over the data.
4. Admin can create user, create IFSC code,update user,delete user,update account,delete account,see transactions.
